            <string>show_message("I remember the day clearly: it was two weeks ago.  I, an employee at Metal Finger Co., was coming in for my daily shift on guard duty when all of a sudden, my boss, Metal Finger, pulled up in his car right outside of the buiding as I was walking to the front door.  Well, I shouldn't say HE pulled in; his driver did, and I shouldn't say his CAR; it was a $5,000,000 limousine.  Priceless artifact.  I turned to greet my boss as he got out of his limo, but he just sighed and commanded me to open the door for him.  Like I'm your slave! I thought, but I had to keep my job.  So, I went over to the door and opened it.  Metal Finger strolled inside and didn't say a word.... not even a thank you.  This, combined with his earlier command, enraged me beyond belief.  This guy may be a billionaire, but he has no decency about him!  I'll show him... Today, I came prepared.  I started with his limo.  Destroyed the thing, left it in a 5,000,000 pieces.  Then, I prepared for my assault on his citadel.  My access card would get me past most of security, but the private floors reserved only for Metal Finger's favorite and most prized employees.... that would be a challenge.  But what fun would it be if it wasn't a challenge, right?");
