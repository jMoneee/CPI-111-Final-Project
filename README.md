# CPI-111-Final-Project
Final Project for Game Development 1
This project was the final project for ASU's CPI111: Game Developement 1 course. This project was worked on by both Joseph Larsen
and Braydon Spangler.
Unfortunately we had some issues with GitHub during the final weeks of the project and were unable to use it for the entirety of
the developement progress so there are many large gaps between branches.
This GitHub Repository also includes other components of the class project, such as the original and revised Game Design Document, 
a video presentation of the game and powerpoint presentation of the final game.
